Might be best to do a dropdown list where users can select a subscription. Wouldn't work because you'd have to have all the different tiers and prices?

Index as it is. Use friendly id gem. Then use subscription title to show different partials depending on the title of the subscription. Will result in a lot of different partials though. 


Many to many relationship between Subscriptions and Users. 


Subscription
Title
